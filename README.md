# Box configuration

Ansible setup for workstation or server.
Freely inspired by [dschier-wtd/fedora-workstation](https://github.com/dschier-wtd/fedora-workstation).

## Usage

The playbook is designed to be used on a localhost via `ansible-playbook` for the workstation playbook
or remotely on hosts from an inventory for the server playbook.

### Requirements

* a RH-based workstation or server / a Debian-based workstation or server
* Ansible
* Python 3 psutil package

#### Ansible & Python 3 psutil

RH-based:
```shell
$ sudo dnf install ansible python3-psutil -y
```

Debian-based:
```shell
$ sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible python3-psutil -y
```

#### Roles and Collections

Before running the actual playboook, it is needed to install required roles
and collections. This can be done in two simple commands:

```shell
# Install collections
ansible-galaxy collection install -r ansible/requirements.yml

# Install roles
ansible-galaxy role install -r ansible/requirements.yml
```

### Run a Playbook

#### Workstation
```shell
# Check run and show diffs
ansible-playbook --check --diff -K ansible/playbooks/workstation/configure.yml -e "hosts_group=localhost"

# Execute the playbook
ansible-playbook -K ansible/playbooks/workstation/configure.yml -e "hosts_group=localhost"
```

#### Server

First create your inventory, for instance:

```shell
cat > ./inventory.yml <<EOF
all:
  vars:
    ansible_private_key_file: ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 # the key used to connect to the hosts, not the one to authorize for users
    ansible_user: root
    hostname: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
    timezone: "Europe/Paris"

    # features
    docker_managed: true
    ohmyzsh_managed: true
    oh_my_zsh_theme: ys
    users:
      - username: root
      - username: mathieu
        ssh_authorized_keys: https://github.com/debovema.keys
        sudoernopassword: true
        docker: true
  children:
    scaleway:
      hosts:
        devno1-3:
          ansible_host: 163.123.45.67
    hetzner:
      hosts:
        devno1-4:
          ansible_host: 2a01:4ff:123:456::2
          feature_wireguard_4in6_tunnel: true
EOF
```

```shell
# Check run and show diffs
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml --check --diff ansible/playbooks/server/configure.yml

# Execute the playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml ansible/playbooks/server/configure.yml
```
